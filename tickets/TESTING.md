# Tira Testing Record

## DD-388

Method: TDD + BDD + ATDD.

### Docker functional and coverage gate

- Shared `perl-test` container: PASS.
- Files: 4.
- Assertions: 133.
- `lib/Tira.pm`: 100.0% statement, 100.0% subroutine.
- `lib/Tira/CLI.pm`: 100.0% statement, 100.0% subroutine.
- Combined: 100.0% statement, 100.0% subroutine.
- `cover_db` removed after the report.

The suite proves project discovery and creation, all three board configurations,
monotonic reference allocation, JSON persistence, rollback, all output modes,
real nested CLI wrappers, `TIRA_HOME` selection and explicit-project
precedence, raw `SKILLS.md`, metadata, versions, and POD.
The metadata gate also proves that the agent manual contains its required
technical sections, exactly 100 uniquely numbered use cases from UC-001 through
UC-100, and no hard-coded home-directory path.

### Installed Developer Dashboard proof

`dashboard skills install ~/projects/skills/skills/tira` installed
version `0.01`. The installed dispatcher successfully ran:

- `dashboard tira.project.create -o json`
- `dashboard tira.sow.create` with default TOON
- `dashboard tira.epic.create -o human` with Markdown
- `dashboard tira.ticket.create -o json`
- `TIRA_HOME=... dashboard tira.ticket.create -o json` without `--project`
- `dashboard tira.skills` with raw Markdown

The disposable project contained `.tira/project.yml`, three `config.yml` files,
and `SOW-001.json`, `EPC-001.json`, and `TKT-001.json` in their Backlog folders.

### Platform gate

- macOS 14.8.5, Homebrew Perl 5.42.2: PASS, 4 files and 122 assertions. The
  first run exposed a `/var` to `/private/var` canonical-path assertion defect;
  the test now compares canonical paths. The final run used macOS's portable
  `C` locale because the VM's inherited `C.UTF-8` locale is unavailable there.
- Windows 11 lab: unavailable. Its Compose stack has no persistent disk, rebuilt
  Windows from scratch, and the unattended configuration does not install or
  configure OpenSSH. The required setup file also contains a redacted password,
  so no safe automated guest command route existed. This is a lab provisioning
  limitation, not a Tira test failure. The stack was shut down.
- `macdev` and `windev` were both shut down immediately after their respective
  verification work. `macdev` was restarted for the `TIRA_HOME` change,
  rerun successfully, and shut down again; both stacks are currently stopped.

### `perlsec` security gate

The final verification sequence used the installed Perl 5.40 `perlsec.pod` and
passed all 133 assertions under `prove -T`. Both modules and every shipped CLI
file compiled under `perl -T`. `Data::TOON` 0.03 and `YAML::PP` 0.41 were
verified. The production source contains no `system`, `exec`, `fork`, `glob`, or
`qx` calls.

The audit caused concrete hardening: canonical and temporary paths are validated
before file mutation, YAML prefixes/digit widths/counters are constrained and
untainted before becoming filenames, nested wrapper library paths are validated
before entering `@INC`, and taint tests sanitize shell-sensitive environment
variables. Tira invokes no external processes. `Data::TOON` supplies bounded
nesting and circular-reference detection for output encoding.

### Release gate

The verified release was committed locally. Push is blocked because the
passphrase-protected `github.mf` SSH identity has no running keyring agent in
this session. The ticket remains open until that commit is pushed.
